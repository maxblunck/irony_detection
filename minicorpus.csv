Duvernois,Gangsta Rap Coloring Book (Paperback),"No, wait, I'm being sarcastic. This is a great novelty gift for preschoolers. No, no, I meant for hip cynical adults. Yeah, that's it."
1,31_9_R1GE9UI3OWCA8M.txt,1.0,"Listening to this ""Hurt"" me!","November 8, 2007","MomKKC ""momkkc""",The Sun Also Rises (Audio CD),"William Hurt cannot read.  At all.  The cadence, inflection, and emotion of Hurt's reading are inappropriate in almost every circumstance, and the accents he attempts are laughable.  I pity the first-time audio listener who might mistakenly pick up this lamentable reading and be turned off audiobooks altogether.  There should be a warning label, ""Danger, listening to William Hurt's reading of ""The Sun Also Rises"" is known to nauseate expectant listeners"".  
 
 On the brighter side, I have listened to many other wonderful readings of Hemingway's works including ""True at First Light"" read by Brian Dennehy and ""A Farewell to Arms"" read by John Slattery.  Do yourself a favor and listen to a different reader."

 The tubes work just fine, but geez, nice way to reward customer loyalty...."
