Duvernois,Gangsta Rap Coloring Book (Paperback),"No, wait, I'm being sarcastic. This is a great novelty gift for preschoolers. No, no, I meant for hip cynical adults. Yeah, that's it."
1,31_9_R1GE9UI3OWCA8M.txt,1.0,"Listening to this ""Hurt"" me!","November 8, 2007","MomKKC ""momkkc""",The Sun Also Rises (Audio CD),"William Hurt cannot read.  At all.  The cadence, inflection, and emotion of Hurt's reading are inappropriate in almost every circumstance, and the accents he attempts are laughable.  I pity the first-time audio listener who might mistakenly pick up this lamentable reading and be turned off audiobooks altogether.  There should be a warning label, ""Danger, listening to William Hurt's reading of ""The Sun Also Rises"" is known to nauseate expectant listeners"".

 On the brighter side, I have listened to many other wonderful readings of Hemingway's works including ""True at First Light"" read by Brian Dennehy and ""A Farewell to Arms"" read by John Slattery.  Do yourself a favor and listen to a different reader."

 The tubes work just fine, but geez, nice way to reward customer loyalty...."
 1,42_11_R1HNFW27RW2MWJ.txt,1.0,WARNING!!!,"November 17, 2002",A Customer,The Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy: Or everything your doctor won't tell you (Paperback),"If you are overweight, or even sensitive about your weight, don't read this book! Iovine can't resist saying ""fat"" without adding ""and ugly"" and she states in the beginning that overweight couch potatoes are not welcome in her circle of ""girlfriends."" Towards the end of the book, she discusses the pregnant waddle, and reasons that all fat people waddle a bit anyway. She sympathizes with her husband for not being attracted to her. After all, you wouldn't want to sleep with someone as fat as you, right? And she confides that her maternity wardrobe ran all the way up to a (gasp) size ten! The horror! Although this book was very entertaining and had some good information, I got tired of being slapped every couple of pages. The author simply can't resist seperating her temporarily round self from those of us who struggle with our weight all the time. Does she not realize that the average American woman is a size 14? I really felt like I was reading this book as an outsider, so I waited until a skinny friend got pregnant and gave it to her. And by the way, Ms. Iovine, I am a size 16 and my husband can't keep his hands off me. It would take a lot more than pregnancy and dark roots to push him away. If your husband is that picky about your looks, I feel sorry for you."
