I'VE FOUND THE LIGHT WITH MY CAPS LOCK KEY
WHENEVER I ACCIDENTALLY HIT THE CAPS LOCK KEY IN THE PAST, A LITTLE LIGHT WOULD COME ON. LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT LIGHT WAS JESUS TRYING TO GET AT MY BRAIN. BUT ONCE I LET HIM IN AND BURNED ALL MY BOOKS AND CONDOMS, I REALIZED THAT THE ONLY CHRISTIAN WAY TO WRITE IS IN ALL CAPS. OTHERWISE THE HOLY SPIRIT WON'T GET ACROSS TO ANYBODY!
 
 THIS IS A FANTASTIC BOOK BUT MY BOOKSHELF IS A BIT SPARSE AS AFTER READING IT I BURNED ALL MY OTHER BOOKS, INCLUDING THE BIBLES AS THEY WERE WRITTEN PARTIALLY IN LOWERCASE LETTERS, OR AS I LIKE TO CALL THEM, THE DEVIL'S RUNES. CAN ANYONE RECOMMEND ME A GOOD ALLCAPS BIBLE?

Fun At First....But Due to Bad Gimmick....Gets Old Fast
The Nintendo Wii has been stated by many to have revolutionized gaming as we know it.  A drastically deep claim to make in such a powerful entertainment medium that revolves around technology.  A claim, that I believed as well.  The idea of playing games with motions is intriguing, enticing, and exciting, something that many use as a decision maker when it comes time to purchase a console.  I was one of the many people who waited in line all night November 18, 2006 for the Nintendo Wii.  
 
 After taking it home that first morning, I was dying from anticipation of playing the newest console made by Nintendo.  I opened the console, I liked what I saw.  The Wii Menu is unique, and is a great way to navigate the console.  The menu displays the contents of the Wii's internal hard-drive, displaying items such as downloaded games, and new channels that may have been purchased.  Navigating the menu requires the usage of the sensor bar and pointing the Wii Remote at the screen to choose the desired channel.  
 
 The games feel unique at first, requiring motions to control on screen avatars within the games.  However, as time goes by, the feeling of revolution is replaced with tedium.  After a few hours of gameplay it becomes obvious that button presses of the past have simply been replaced with simple gestures that do not represent the actual on screen action.  For example: in past games in order to attack you may have been required to press "A" but the Wii replaces this with a simple "shake" of the controller.  It doesn't even matter as to which direction the controller is shaken in either, seeing as the gesture will not match the onscreen motions.  The majority of the games on the Wii really only use five different gestures, simply recycled over and over again.  These gestures include: shake controller left, shake controller right, shake controller up, shake controller down, and thrust controller forward.  These gestures do not actually allow the gamer to feel immersed in the game, since these gestures are no different than button pressing.  The added drawback of these motions is the inaccuracy of the detection of them as well.  
 
 Where I started to lose faith in the Wii was after picking up some hardcore games for the console.  I began by purchasing Resident Evil 4, Okami, Madworld, No More Heroes, Mortal Kombat Armageddon, Dragonball Z Tenkaichi 2 and 3, Twilight Princess, and more.  I started to realize that with these games, precision is an absolute must.  However, the Wii remote's motion controller actually takes away from the precision due to the poor detection skills of the controller.  This results in lag, delayed moves, incorrect moves, and more.  In several of these games, I found myself repeating missions and levels simply due to the fact that the Wiimote would make my on screen character perform the wrong moves.  For example:  in Twilight Princess, the shield bash is done by pushing the nunchuk forward, however, sometimes this registered as the nunchuk being moved to the side which corresponds with a spin attack.  Similar scenarios began to play out with all of the Wii games I purchased.  Every game began to get more frustrating and I began to play my Playstation 3 more and more.  Finally, I came to a conclusion, traditional controls just work better for playing games, period.  
 
 The graphics of the Wii are fine, in my opinion, despite the lack of HD.  Graphics alone do not make a game fun, and that is why I continue to play PSOne and Nintendo 64 games to this day.  However, the unresponsive controller gestures of the Wii are enough to turn me away from the console.  I'm still hoping that Microsoft and Sony don't try to follow Nintendo too much with motion control gameplay seeing as it actually makes games more difficult and frustrating to play.  If you're a gamer looking for a console with great games, is a lot of fun, and can be played for hours on end with full precision and control, don't go with the Wii.  You can't go wrong with either a PS3 or a 360 though, both offer a wide variety of games in every genre and both respond the way you tell them to.  The Wii may have enough perks to attract you if you stick to games such as Super Smash Bros Brawl, Guilty Gear and other games that allow the option of playing with either a classic remote or a GameCube controller, but not enough games give players this option.  Also, if you're not looking for games that contain in depth controls, than perhaps you will do just fine with the Wii.  The Wii has its ups, and its downs, but for me personally, it has been a disappointment.

We fixed it! (ok, THEY fixed it!)
I am (as you will read) completely ignorant about car stereo stuff.  I wanted to put this story in here just in case it helps someone else to get their unit working!
 
 I got this for my birthday (off my wish list).  It does pretty much what it says it will do. :)  I wanted HD Radio (I live in Houston) and a way to play ANY OTHER DEVICE through an aux port on the front.  The USB hookup was gravy.
 
 
 
 So, I had it installed a couple of days ago.  Worked great, but when my RPM's increased from my engine, a DEFINITE WHINE also came out of the speakers.
 
 I took it back to the shop that installed it.  They came out and hemmed and hawed and said some things about DUAL being a crappy radio and there was nothing they could do.
 
 ... well, they could try a COUPLE of things, maybe. :)
 
 So first they tried these $24 noise filter thingies ($24 for 2).  Those didn't work.
 
 So the main installer guy just kept looking sad for me and I kept looking hopeful.
 
 He tried grounding the radio to the chassis.  That didn't work.
 
 (more sad looking guy, more determinedly hopeful me)
 
 Then he said, "Well, I can try one more thing, but I'm sure this won't work.  It's a &lt;stereoguyterm>... DUAL's too cheap to put them on their radios and I have to cut them off of other radios occasionally... so I've got some of them in the back."
 
 He installed whatever it was on the power supply side (?) and it worked FANTASTIC(ly).
 
 It looked like a little black box and I think was a filter of some sort on the power side.
 
 They didn't charge me anything for the adventure, but obviously should have.
 
 I drive a Toyota Sienna minivan with JBL stuff on my speakers.  Apparently that was important.  
 
 Now it works great.  Reception in Houston has been great.  It plays through the line-in Aux port great (I use it with my ipod and creative zen) and USB keys work.  I'm not sure it ever shows the file names it's playing off the USB, which is weird but not worth $100 to upgrade to a better stereo.
 
 So, it works but had quite a bit of fiddling to make it go.
 
 It's great for the $.  I have fairly low standards... I only listen to audiobooks, podcasts, NPR, etc.  So I have no idea what the audiophiles would think.  
 
 
 (and, for the snarky, YES, there was a sale on the word "great" today.)

Wow what a way to start off your career with one of the best debut albums ever! This album is non-stop rock. And I don't mean fake rock such as The Who or Led Zeppelin; I mean stuff that actually takes TALENT to creat (those guys were just hippies on acid trips who have no ability to create good music). Ashlee can play instuments for the record, I've even seen a picture of her with a guitar which proves it. She composed this music ON HER OWN and didn't just touch up her voice in the studio like these posers will tell you. Also you bitch about her lip synching. Well LOL everybody does it LOL. You should get this, but ignore talentless poser "singers" such as Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo.

A great addition to a used Delorean
I had recently purchased a used car from my friend Dr. Emmitt Brown, and was told I needed to purchase nuclear material to enjoy the full benefits of the car.  I saw this item on Amazon and thought I was in luck.  Unfortunately, the use of uranium in my Delorean had some unforseen consequences.  As I entered a California freeway, I knew I had to speed up to 90 MPH, or I would be run off the road.  As I approached this speed, many weird things started to happen, and long story short, I was somehow transported to the year 1996.  Knowing the past sports outcomes of the last decade, I went to Las Vegas and correctly predicted the winner of every World Series, Super Bowl, NBA Finals.  Now, I am a billionaire and married to my childhood sweetheart, after I killed her husband.  Thank you uranium ore, for making my dreams come true.

IPod and ITunes are buggy, proprietary junk
I bought this for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas. I was very excited for her. I installed itunes on her computer (REQUIRED) and loaded it full of music, videos and apps. ITunes crashes a LOT and is VERY SLOW! Got it all loaded, she opened it, then none of the apps work! You click on an app and it opens up for about .2 of a second and closes immediately. The apps that come with it work, just none of the added ones. Well, Apple support was closed for 3 days until Monday! On the Apple site their wonderful support has you give them a date/time to call you back rather than just have help available. I went through like 5 horrible set up screens on the Apple web site to get them to call me back Monday to help with their broken Christmas present and WHOLA, the VERY LAST PAGE of the support site gave me some error message about the Apple web servers. Amazing. I think they need to re-do their ads that say Microsoft has buggy products. I am very computer savy and googled around and found the web REPLETE with similar problems. No solution worked except completely reformatting the ipod, creating a new account, and not letting itunes copy the apps for me. Then it worked. When it worked, I loved it. Therein is the problem. A 5 star product is a 1 star product if it is only good as a paperweight. Well, later that same day, we were adding apps and then the new ones started with the opening then immediately closing thing again. Reformatting and reloading everything twice a day is not a viable solution. I returned it.
 
 That is not all of my fun with Apple. I did like the product WHEN IT WORKED so I went to the Apple store at the Mall of Georgia near Atlanta, GA. I told one of the 'geniuses' my problem to which she said she had a similar problem. She then continued to be unbelievably rude with comments like 'stop interrupting me' when I was just trying to clarify what was happening with my product when she stated something different than what I was saying along with 'what do you want me to do?' along with a 'Want me to get the manager?'. I was amazingly calm considering the level of bad attitude. I then told her that all I wanted a warm and fuzzy. I just wanted to know that I got a bad ipod and that it is a rare condition because I wanted to buy one that day. She did not do that. I then thanked her for helping me make up my mind and went out and got a Zune HD and love it. It works great. I already own an older IPod 30gb and a macbook 13''. They work well but are NOT bug free and as simple as advertised. I will not, however, be buying a single Apple product ever again thanks to the unbelievable rudeness of the 'genius' and the problems I had with this Christmas present on Christmas day for my daughter.
 
 Also, the IPod is married to ITunes and the ITunes store. Most good media players give you access to the device for more of a tinkerer who wants to control the folder formats, what goes where, etc. Not a bunch of locked down, buggy, slow, DRM LADEN, confusing interfaces. The IPod makes you use ITunes. That DRM garbage and Apple only tie in junk proves it is Apple, not the 'evil' Microsoft that is all about the $$$. Hey, I'm a capitalist, but don't be so greedy and monopolistic about it. Anyway, I excecised my right as a Capitalist to go by a competing, easier, better product...the Zune.  And Zune has apps coming. Oh, and I have the G1 Android phone and love it. It has an app store, that went from nothing to a zillion apps in no time also. I bet the Zune one will soon also.

Best razor on the market today..PERIOD!!
I have been a long time user of the Gillette Manual Fusion Razor then I bought a ProGlide Power Razor about 2 weeks before it was actually released and all I can say is WOW...this razor is by far the best razor out there today, no doubt about it...This razor makes shaving a breeze and it does not drag across your face, nick or cut you in any way...it provides the closest shave you can possibly get without going into an "old-school" barber and getting a straight razor shave..Yes, the blades are expensive but you really do "Get What You Pay For" so if you want cheap blades then expect a lousy shave with cuts and knicks..if you want an extremely close and comfortable shave with minimal effort then this is the razor for you...I recommend getting the Power Razor as it really does make a difference while shaving and it does provide a closer shave than a manual razor..Also, get rid of that crap-in-a-can gel or foam and get yourself some natural cream that you lather with a badger brush (Truefitt & Hill, Proraso, etc) and you will really see this ProGlide Power come to life..A+++ razor that I will continue to use no matter the cost of the blades...Face it, us dudes have to shave daily (or almost daily) so why go cheap and tear up your face if you do not have to..

A lovely wallow of deep depression
Some drama films are the kind that you feel emotional resonance for the characters, feel mildly engaged by the plot, think about it for a few seconds after leaving the theater, get into your car, get pissed off at a stupid driver, and quickly move back into your own life. The Lovely Bones isn't that kind of movie.
 
 Director Peter Jackson, of Lord of the Rings and King Kong fame, doesn't seem like the most obvious choice to direct the adaptation of the seemingly untouchable Alice Sebold novel, but he does his best, by staying close to the source material, but occasionally taking things out here and there. He also brings alot of ah-mazing CGI shots that are so gorgeous, they may be worth the price of admission alone, and I doubt we would've had that type of a movie if anybody else had directed it. However, you get the feeling that Jackson paid too much attention to the CGI aspect, while he could've dealt with the center plot issue with more directorial sensitivity, mocking the same way the book was written, and that's what stops this from being a perfect movie.
 
 The plot centers around Susie Salmon (played by Saoirse Ronan), a 14-year-old girl who is raped and murdered in 1973. Ronan was absolutely perfect in this role. She showed promise in the 2007 film Atonement, where she also played a terrified youth who is dealing with an unbelievable situation. In the film, Susie is watching over her family, the boy she was in love with, and her killer -- from her own personal heaven.
 
 Stanley Tucci nails his role, playing the demented serial killer Mr. Harvey. He gives a particularly chilling, and uncannily believable performance, showing more versatility with every film he makes, you can tell that he really got lost in this role, because his part isn't one of those where you find yourself wondering what the actor has previously starred in -- you see his character, and he does a damn fine job at it.
 
 Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz and Susan Sarandon play Susie's family, and each of those roles require the actor to display quite alot of emotion, grieving her loss, and they all do terrific work, causing you to feel the extreme remorse that their characters do, and I really don't know if better actors could have been selected to play the respective parts.
 
 Nikki SooHoo plays Holly, a girl who Susie meets in heaven, another victim of Mr. Harvey. Her role is particularly memorable, serving as something of a reassuring voice to the Ronan's character, and I see her doing great things in her future, because, while being an unknown actress, she shows just as much talent as the other actors in this all-star cast.
 
 The core of this movie, however, the reason to go and see it in a packed theatre, doesn't lie in its acting, or the writing, or even the direction. It lies in the story. We've all wondered what happens to us after we die. The Lovely Bones suggests that we go to a world that we think is perfect, but we're still haunted by the things that troubled us in our lives. And while the movie leaves you heartbroken, wanting to spend every day you have on this earth as your last, it leaves you pondering your own life, the significance of it, how you'll be remembered. And that's something I particularly like in a film, when it not only moves you to the point where tears are flooding your eyes, but when it leaves you with a great deal of psychological issues to ponder, about your own life, and what comes after your life is ultimately over. And that's what The Lovely Bones does. And while staying true to the source material, that's all a fan of this story can ask for.

Best BlackBerry on the Market at this Time!
I've been a long time AT&T costumer. I thought I could live without having an actual keyboard when it comes to texting, but after a week without my Sidekick Keyboard - I decided to ditch my Samsung Eternity for the Blackberry Bold 9700.

I was hesitant about purchasing this smart phone because I was never a fan of Blackberry's (RIMM). I had a BB during their initial boom in the early part of the new millennium. However, the poor browser, poor cell phone network, lackluster screen color, non desirable keyboard, awful battery life, whack OS, & lack of T9 predictive text just couldn't win me over.

After I realized that I couldn't text on a touch screen phone, unless it was the iPhone. I decided that I must have a cell phone device with an actual qwerty keyboard, if I expect to survive my text message & email addiction.

I picked up the Blackberry 9700 with my corporate discount and walked away with a nice high end phone at a very reasonable price. I have to say that I really enjoy the web browser on the new BB. You can zoom in & out with ease. I thought no browser could compare to the iPod Safari besides the Android G1, but after getting this device - I can safely say that this browser is also one of the best. Its right behind the safari and G1. Prior models were confined to small screens, thirty-five dollar internet only data plans, and no ability to zoom in or out. You were subjected to a small screen and reading small text till your eyes was squinting like grandmas.

Pros:
3G
New Optical Trackpad (Over the old Trackball)
Big vibrant screen
Threaded Text Messaging
3.5 MM headjack
New OS (Runs a bit quicker without the lag time)
Decent call quality
Excellent new broswer
Mini SD up to 32GB
Use your songs as ringers
Wi-Fi
Personal Email (Up to 10 accounts can be added)
IM
Themes
App Store
My Favs
Full HTML Web Browser (Sometimes)
Excellent Multimedia Player (Accepts every format possible)
Includes 2 chargers (Wall Charger & USB charger)
Includes ear phones and carry case

Cons:
For long time BB users, this device is really just a cosmetic upgrade with a new OS (Flashier Icons)
Micro USB (No more Mini USB)
Video & Camera (3.2 Megapixel as oppose to 8.0)
Cheap plastic rubber casing

Non RIMM Consumer Changes Mind!

For anyone who has wanted a BB but held off on getting one and want an entry level Blackberry at a decent price - this is the model to get. Everything about it is an upgrade. The device is basically the BB Bold with a different casing. The battery life could still use some more juice. With excessive email checking & non stop texting, the phone usually needs a charge after a day and a half of usage (Sometimes i can go a charge for 2 days before a charge so thats not bad). I did set the brightness of the phone to the lowest brightness available and it has lasted for a little over 2 days with no charge needed. Even on the lowest brightness, the screen is still very bright, sharp, & crisp. And i still do unlimited texting & web browsing. However, AT&T doesn't offer the best mobile minute plans on earth & their data plan is probably one of themost expensive around. They are fully aware that their signal is one of the best & in doing so, make up for it by charging their non-friendly services at non-friendly prices, which usually doesn't offers an abundant amount of minutes, unlimited data, internet, email, text etc will end up costing you a lot!

I pay under seventy bucks a month for a decent amount of mins & unlimited everything else. My friend has a similar plan on Verizon, its not unlimited, and her bill is always over a hundred each month.

Disappointing workout DVD
People, this DVD is NOT for anyone who is already active and is less than 20 lbs. overweight. I bought this because it seemingly had three 20-minute cardio segments and I thought I'd get a great cardio workout. NOT. In the 1st segment, the instructor is primarily running his mouth (in an attempt to motivate) and not really participating much in the actual routine. All you see is several blubbery, out of shape, out of breath flabby folks who cannot stay in unison or use proper technique to save their lives. The viewer is left with a mish-mash of poor technique and a flamboyant instructor running his mouth (and hovering around the "boys"). This may be a helpful start for those who have never worked out in their lives and who are 75 lbs OR MORE overweight but for those of us who've been moderate-to extremely active and have less than 20-30 lbs. to lose, you may not find this DVD useful on any level. I am used to seeing in-shape and toned bodies on my workout DVD's, providing a VISUAL GOAL for myself. Right? Why would someone who is hoping to drop a few lbs want to see grossly out-of-shape folks on their TV screen? I give them props for getting off their bottoms and trying to get healthy. But I truly recommend this DVD to the extremely overweight and inactive.
 The other 2 segments at least have the instructors working out (more than the 1st instructor) but the routines are low-cardio and mundane. And of course, the group is way out of unison. 
 *I was aware that the Biggest Loser cast was in the video; I just didn't realize they'd be so awful and pathetic. Sorry for the unkind words.

The Awesomeness of Audrey
Sam Wasson's just-released and delightful book on the making of "Breakfast at Tiffany's" is so chock-full of great anecdotes that you're sorry when it's over.  For awhile, you are there - a privileged insider-witness to a marvelous bygone moment in moviemaking history - and it's with a feeling of bittersweet regret that you step from its closing pages back into a realm of noisy 3D sequels and superfluous comic book franchises. Everything you'd want to know and more is delivered in the book, from the reader's coverage producer Marty Jurow was first handed, re: adapting Capote's book for the screen ("In any event this is more of a character sketch than a story. NOT RECOMMENDED") to the guest list for the post-premiere party (including such unlikely elbow-rubbers as Dennis Hopper, Buster Keaton, Charles Laughton, and Jane Mansfield).
 
 A delicious through-line in the book is how close the movie came to not coming out so well as it did, with such jaw-droppers as everyone's resistance to having Henry Mancini write a song for the thing (eventual collaborator Johnny Mercer's original lyric, we learn, one of three eventually presented to Mancini, was called "Blue River").  An intimate exploration of the myriad personalities in conflict and collusion when a casual classic is being created, the book is cannily adept at detailing the logic of the so many minute decisions that lead to what we now accept as inevitable.  Of course Audrey Hepburn played Holly Golightly, you think, until you hear how hard Capote lobbied for Marilyn Monroe.
 
 Wasson is a formidable researcher.  He doesn't so much know where the bodies are buried as he knows where the hearts and minds are hidden.  The book is written like a good novel, taking you inside the consciousness of its characters with an impressive, insight-laden believability ("Fifth Avenue"'s only recent movie-book rival in this regard is Mark Harris' fascinating "Pictures at a Revolution"). And Wasson's notes on how he arrived at, and can justify, his leaps of imagination and empathy are almost as interesting as the text itself.
 
 Of course the book has its thesis and theories as well, positing "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and Hepburn's stylish, fresh, era-defining performance as a watershed moment in cultural history.  If you're a fan of Audrey Hepburn, the book is a must-have, because Wasson's astute take on what she was about, what she was up against, and how she delivered the goods strikes me as definitive.  Her spritely, near-angelic spirit comes alive in the pages of this eminently devour-able book, which is kind of an awesome dividend.

ok for contemporary
I have read about 5 books by Nora Roberts.  My favorite was Honest Illusions.  I tend to read historical romance.  A friend gave me my first Nora Roberts' book Born in Fire.  That series of three books held my  interest to try another book of Ms. Roberts.  Honest Illusions I could  keep; the others all went back.  Tucker and Caro were a good match, but my  favorite character was Cy.  I had a strong feeling who the killer was  during the pathology section in the book.  (Don't want to spoiler it for  others.)  The actual killer isn't revealed until about three pages before  the book ends; and I felt some people should have moved out-of-the-area (if  you catch my drift).  Hard for people to forget and forgive in a story  about serial killers.  Sorry all you Nora Roberts' fans.  I had better  stick to historicals.

Whole Rabbit - NOT!
I ordered one of these Fresh "Whole" Rabbits, but when it arrived its head, fur and insides were missing.  Not exactly whole, I'd say!  Maybe it was just damaged during shipping, but I won't be buying another one.  I mean - without the long ears, how do I know it even WAS a rabbit?  It was the same size and shape as a cat...not that I've seen a cat with its head, fur and insides missing.  I mean, not like really close or anything.
 
 On the plus side, it was delicious with a tall, cold glass of Tuscan Milk, so I give it three stars.  That's three WHOLE stars, BTW.

Not complete without the line....
This toy would be a lot more realistic with about 350 people standing in line for an average of an hour.  It still makes a nice set with the interrogation room.

Best solution for irrital bowel syndrome
My 86-year-old mother suffered for years from irritable bowel syndrome, making countless trips to the emergency room for the pain and bloating.  I talked her into using this Acacia Tummy Fiber, and now that she uses it faithfully she rarely has an attack of IBS.  We used to buy it direct from Heather's IBS, but Amazon has a better price!

An amazing feat of magic
Woe, thine gift of fire-less light! I am not one to fear the elements, but this "bi cycle light" has affected my spirit. How it works, I do not know. But it must be through mysticism and not fire, for it is not hot and nor does it flicker. Either it was formed through enchamberment of bright holy faeries or through sheer magics alone.
 
 It came to me through Amazonia, and I expect that such people of the dark jungles would find strange new manners to produce light. I have seen flash powders for making instant fires, and glass crystals that can change the color of fire and sunlight. But never have I seen light from nothingness. Amazonia must have powerful enchanters indeed.
 
 Moreso, this includes an enchanted reflector. It appears to be meant to be secured to some sort of pole, like a staff. I have secured it to my walking staff under the assumption that it protects me from evil lights, and reflects them as a harmless red glow. It's a fine idea to package both a light producer and a light consumer (shield), but nowhere is it written the form of light produced. I do hope that the enchantment is not soul-sucking and am currently testing it on a virgin's skin.

Plays tracks in alphanumeric order
This is a great MP3/WMA player with one glaring deficiency: It insists on playing the songs in alphanumerical order by track title. The manual states this, customer support verified it and I couldn't find a reasonable work-around, so it went back. Sure you can manually move from one song to another as they play, but if you want to load an entire CD and listen to the songs in the order in which you're accustomed, it won't do it without interaction. In my opinion, this is a colossal design flaw. The original MuVo 64 and 128 will play the tracks in the order which you load them but not this one. If that won't bother you, the MuVo NX is the one to get.

Blatant false advertising
I ordered 300 of these individually gift wrapped for a client's wedding and was horrified to learn 14 minutes before the reception that this is NOT REAL CRYSTAL!!!  From an arms length and after 3 stoli martinis this could easily pass for Ireland's finest leaded or even a clear quartz from the mines of Malay but one look under the jewelers glass and it was immediately apparent that Bic was using low grade plastique.  I will give their craftsmen due credit for their obvious mastery with the grinding and polishing wheels, as i've rarely encountered such precision in a "cigarette cut" piece.  But crystal?  Snort! I THINK NOT!

Atrocious
Out of all the movies that I've ever seen this past year, this is definitely one of the worst and most pathetic movies I've ever felt like I wanted to go away. Paris Hilton gives a very unconvincing performance as she tries to do whatever it takes to make her friend a better attractive woman to men. Sadly, for someone who really never learned her lessons and lied about giving back to others on Larry King Live, Paris Hilton showed no effort of changing her ways, and also showed she really doesn't have the drive to act. Not even die hard Paris Hilton fans would even come close to being interested in this movie.

My niece loves this toy.
What an awesome idea for a childs toy.
 I bought one for my niece, wanting to instill the proper values in her starting at a young age.
 This baby doesn't cry, doesn't eat.
 All it wants is a smoke.
 And what's wrong with that?
 By the time I get home from another hellish day at the office that's all I want.
 Why not start early and learn those addictive coping habits before they get old enough to rebel.
 Now, if the company can just come out with one more baby.
 The others are coke baby, this one comes with a straw and a mirror.
 Heroin baby, comes with it's own set of syringes.
 And of course weed baby that comes with a huge blunt.
 The only one we're missing is crack/meth baby that comes with it's own pipes and is missing half it's head and an eye.
 Now THAT is one toy my niece cannot go without.
 Anyway....the smoking baby is fun, educational, and a must have.
 And in case you really are that stupid, yes this review is a joke.
 Lighten up.
 Or in this case....light up. :)

Listening to this "Hurt" me!
William Hurt cannot read.  At all.  The cadence, inflection, and emotion of Hurt's reading are inappropriate in almost every circumstance, and the accents he attempts are laughable.  I pity the first-time audio listener who might mistakenly pick up this lamentable reading and be turned off audiobooks altogether.  There should be a warning label, "Danger, listening to William Hurt's reading of "The Sun Also Rises" is known to nauseate expectant listeners".  
 
 On the brighter side, I have listened to many other wonderful readings of Hemingway's works including "True at First Light" read by Brian Dennehy and "A Farewell to Arms" read by John Slattery.  Do yourself a favor and listen to a different reader.

DIY MST3000
This movie is awesome. After careful consideration, ive decided that no person could possibly make a movie THIS BAD unless that is their goal; and boy does Uwe Boll deliver. Everything is perfect: the dialogue, the cast, cinematography, music, sound effects, wow. Wrap these elements into an incoherent storyline and you have all the ingredients for an alcohol-fueled film party of epic proportions. A movie so bad it has to be seen to believed. MARCO!!!

A Bit Contradictory
These pills will definitely help you lose weight, though I think a large component of the weight lost is merely water. Like other reviewers have stated, this product will dehydrate you like nothing else. It does a great job at suppressing your appetite, so when you do eat, you're more likely to "remember" to eat something healthy - as opposed to raiding the fridge when you're ravenous. 
 
 These pills have helped me lose weight (I'm not talking a ton of weight, but enough to keep me re-purchasing the product). My only complaint is this: this seller - and many sellers of this product - claim the following: "PACKAGES WITH SILVER ON BOTH SIDES ARE FAKE! The authentic capsules are are packaged with green foil on one side and silver on the other. Beware of sellers that lie to you about all silver packaging. The fake all silver packaging is not effective, so don't waste your money." See above item description. 
 
 Uh, anyway -- the item I received had silver on BOTH sides. Does that mean the seller sold me a fake product? If so, why would he/she broadcast that? Who knows. I ordered these pills before from a different seller and the packaging has ALWAYS been silver on both sides. Perhaps this seller can  either 1) remove that verbiage that says the product I purchased from his/her company is FAKE, or 2) clarify whether the packaging has changed since the above claim.

Transcending. Compositional genius.
Anyone whos truly knows muzak knows that Lindsay Lohan is one of the most talented young musakians in the world today. She has proved that many times. She also proved that she is one of the best guitarists every in the contempary cinema classic Freaky Friday. Have posers like Al Di Meola had their own movies where they document their so-called "great" guitar playing?? No. Do you know why? Because they suck. The Muzak on this album is some of the best ever. Lohan along with Avril Lavigne are the two best guitar players in the world. They are better than those "classical" posers who don't look cool at all. The drumming shows wannabees like Peart and Bruford how it should be done. The bass shows self-proclaimed bass "masters" like Stu Hamm that crappy "inversions" (I don't know what that means) and lame techniques like "tapping", "counterpoint" and "slap and pop" (I have no idea what these mean either) are just crap that losers with no talent do.
 
 If you do not like this then you have bad taste.
